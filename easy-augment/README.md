# Easy Augmentor


> End to end software to capture new objects using RGBD camera and augment them to get a annotated dataset to train deep nets

1) Pipeline to artificial generate annotated data for training deep learning models.
2) Pipeline includes starting from capturing images using provided camera (Realsense),
generate semantic labels of the captured image and then generate the artificial images.
3) GUI required for the end user from capturing to labelling and generating new data.
